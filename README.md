# Personal Portfolio

_You arrive in the hush of a Nordic twilight._  
Above, ribbons of emerald and violet aurora breathe across the sky, shifting with the wind’s invisible hand. A subtle glow illuminates the forest path ahead — your first step into this digital journey.

## 🌌 The Forest Awakens
The moment you land, a gentle sound — forest ambience, crisp air, distant owls — fades in.  
It’s not just visual; it’s a **sensory welcome**, a reminder that every pixel here is crafted with intent. The aurora above isn’t a static backdrop — it dances, sways, and blooms with **real-time animation**, powered by precision web technologies.

## 📷 The Creative Space
The path leads to an open clearing.  
Here, walls of light hold moments in time — **photographs**, frozen yet alive.  
Click one, and it expands into the air, dimming everything else. You can almost hear the shutter’s echo. Swipe, tap, or press your keyboard arrows to move between frames — a gallery designed for both touch and thought.

## ✍️ The Storyteller’s Desk
Leaving the gallery, you find a small desk lit by a warm lamp.  
Stacks of writing drafts and open journals invite you to pause. Each page shares the stories, experiences, and learnings that fuel the creativity behind the lens and the code.

## 🛠 The Workshop
Past the desk is a quiet workshop — shelves lined with carefully made digital projects.  
They are more than code; they are crafted artefacts built with **modern web tools** — React, Vite, Tailwind — each piece honed to balance performance with aesthetic clarity.  

## 🤝 The Meeting Place
Finally, the trail opens into a fireside clearing.  
A simple sign reads: *Let’s Talk*.  
Whether you’re here to collaborate, commission, or simply share stories, this is where the conversation begins.
